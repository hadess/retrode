This is a list of changes that could be made in either the firmware
or the driver to make the Retrode easier to use. There might be
reasons why those weren't done yet, and we'll update as those
come to light.

- Would be nice if the firmware had different descriptors
  for the N64 and the SNES pads, so we'd know which one
  is plugged in (as the plugin needs to be plugged into
  the device on boot anyway)
- Remove button 3 from the mouse in firmware
- Differentiate 3/6/2/1 button controllers for the Megadrive port?
- Export the exact firmware in bcdDevice? (no beta tag)
- Bump folder mtime when loading a new cartridge
